      For this project we worked with our client, the captain of the team to redesign their current site. The main objective was to not only update the site but make it more desirable for all users to use. This would include updating the overall look and adding lots of new features. 
In this project I worked with other group members to follow a redesign process and successfully work with a client to create an awesome output. I conducted most of the interview and user data we collected as well as design and layout for our final project.

After looking over the site for ourselves we had in mind some changes we already wanted to make and some changes in the current format of the site, but first we sat down with the client to really understand what she wanted and expected from this redesign. Going into this meeting with had some questions set up to ask as well as some example sites that we could use as reference to really give our client a better understanding and picture of what was expected. Our client gave us a list of specifics she needed for the site:

Our client had a clear idea of what she wanted and expected from our redesign of the site, the next step was to go out to the users and see what the expect and want out of the site. In talking to our client and users overall we found three main user types emerge that we would focus on and create a website that is ideal for all our users to be satisifed with as well as meeting the client's needs. 

Our users were broken down into current players, prospective players, and visitors and fans. How each of these user groups use the site varies a lot but to create a successful site all users have to have incentive and features they can use.

        When drawing up the design of our site we were going through several different designs and functions that the site would feature. We started off as being an informative site that was community oriented, in that we wanted to encourage social aspects. The overall purpose of the site was to inform users and help them find other people and organizations for more hiking information.

        After sketching out the designs we started to wireframe the layout and had some changes to the design. We felt the site was too much like other sites that are already out there for hikers and with social media the way it is, no one would come to the site just for another social outlook. We decided to move towards our site being more of a tool then just a place for information, yet still having links to the social groups. Overall the layout was pretty simple with a lot of content for each trail.

        After laying out our wireframes and performing some simple user testing and getting user feedback we found that our main focus of the site should be a quick way for users to find a trial specific to their desires. This lead to a redesign in our homepage- which would become the main interaction of our site. We decided to have our filter feature be on the homepage so the user could jump right in to finding what they wanted.
