      For this project we worked with our client, the captain of the team to redesign their current site. The main objective was to not only update the site but make it more desirable for all users to use. This would include updating the overall look and adding lots of new features. 
In this project I worked with other group members to follow a redesign process and successfully work with a client to create an awesome output. I conducted most of the interview and user data we collected as well as design and layout for our final project.

After looking over the site for ourselves we had in mind some changes we already wanted to make and some changes in the current format of the site, but first we sat down with the client to really understand what she wanted and expected from this redesign. Going into this meeting with had some questions set up to ask as well as some example sites that we could use as reference to really give our client a better understanding and picture of what was expected. Our client gave us a list of specifics she needed for the site:

Our client had a clear idea of what she wanted and expected from our redesign of the site, the next step was to go out to the users and see what the expect and want out of the site. In talking to our client and users overall we found three main user types emerge that we would focus on and create a website that is ideal for all our users to be satisifed with as well as meeting the client's needs. 

Our users were broken down into current players, prospective players, and visitors and fans. How each of these user groups use the site varies a lot but to create a successful site all users have to have incentive and features they can use. 
        </p>
            <p> After interviewing users across all user groups we found commonalities in what they all wanted in the site and what they expected to find (strictly feature wise).  </p>

        Now that we had a good idea of what our client and users wanted out of the site it was time to go check out what was currently being done on other college athletics sites, professional athletics sites, and other modern well designed sites. Through this process we identified different aspects of design in sites that we found had good qualities as well as certain features we found on different sites that we felt would successfully display the information we needed. In doing this analysis we found qualities that we wanted to incorporate into our site as well as features we wanted to avoid. 

The main takeaways we found and wanted to use in our site were:</p>
<ul>
<li><span>There are some great aspects we would like to mimic for our site that we found on other sites,
The use of a carousel on the home page displaying images and linking to the blog posts for upcoming games tournaments and results and posts about past games. </span></li>
<li><span>
In terms of layout we got some great ideas for using imagery in the background and incorporating team photos in the site to show off the brand. </span></li>
 <li><span>
We got some great examples of how to implement social media (like Twitter) onto the website so people can read the latest tweets as well as post from the site. UCSB had a great widget for this.</span></li>
<li><span>
To display a schedule for the season Cal Poly had a great calendar feature that we would like to incorporate into the site. 
UCLA had a great recap carousel that displayed results and linked to the recap of the game.  </span></li>

</ul>
                 <p>
Below are some of the sites we went through and things we really liked and wanted to use when creating our site. Along with our decision on the terms to have in our navigation bar and a mood board that we used as inspiration on what the overall feel and look we want our site to encompass.

            For our final product we made some major design changes that we felt helped our site have more of a modern and open look and feel. We took out having an image as the background and made it a solid color instead. We also went away from the more boxed sectioned layout and tried to open up the site by not having all the content being separated by boxes.  Along with layout we also tried to incorporate and keep the color variability minimal and more focused on the team’s color- blue, gold, and white.  The final product satisfied our customer and gave her the rich imagery, friendly personality, and modern look she was looking to display.
