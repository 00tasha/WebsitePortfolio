                    <p>My name is Natasha and I recently graduated from the University of California, San Diego. I received my BA in Cognitive Science accompanied by a minor in Economics. I have a drive for UX/UI design and hope to grow more knowledgeable within the topics. Being exposed to the many aspects that go into a successful application has taught me a lot about the requirements and mindset one needs when being involved in the User design field. I love being creative and working with others to achieve big goals. I am a hard worker who is dedicated to producing quality and successful projects. I am an eager learner who always strives to grow by using the resources (and people) around me. I love being active and have been playing soccer since I was 6 years old. On weekends I like to go on hikes or go out biking with friends.</p>
