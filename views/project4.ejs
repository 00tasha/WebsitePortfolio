        Xtime is company that provides a scheduling platform to dealerships so customers can schedule to bring their car into the dealership online from their computer or mobile device. 
While I was with the company I was to go over the mobile design for redesign as well as set up Google Analytics for both mobile and desktop platforms.

First I went out to have users test out the current app design and have them talk out loud while going through the app. The users were given an objective like a car model, repairs needed to be done, and date and time of appointment they needed to make, this helped relieve the user of focusing on these details that weren't important, but how they accomplished these types of objectives. At the end of the test I would ask the user some basic questions regarding their experience in using the app to get a better insight of their opinions on the app.         </p>

        <p>After conducting user testing I looked at the results for any conclusions I could make about the overall flow and usability of the app. 
              One thing many people complained about, which was unexpected was a lot of people were annoyed with the service packaging set up. There was no set up in the prompt on which service people were to get, encouraging them to look through the available packages to get there thoughts and see what they chose. A lot of frustration was created when people looked back and forth between the factory and dealer recommended packages and realized that they were the same. A common comment was this is pointless, or what is the reason for this? 
Another snag was people ignored the trim option and most of the time randomly selected one, this was however preformed before the I Don’t Know option was implemented. 
Many people found the calendar interactions confusing and the feature itself puzzling.
It took a little time for some people to actually figure out how to select a time

The main takeaway was that the first steps- and especially scheduling- contained wording and usability that confused users, a lot.

     To get even more input on users who were using the Xtime mobile app and see where certain issues were arising I was in charge of setting up trackers through Google Analytics. This would give us data on where users were spending a lot of time, dropping out, getting confused, and so on. I worked with the engineers to implement these trackers in the correct spots and making sure the correct functions were being recorded.

        <p>The big issues with the scheduling step was- first the calendar feature was confusing to users. They didn’t understand what it meant and it wasn’t always clear that it was clickable. Second the time selection usability was not very clear and seemed very detached from the calendar. So my objective was to come up with new or different ways to have users select a day and time available to bring their car into the dealership.  </p>

        <p>The first redesign I did. 
With this design I kept close to the original design just thinking of new ways to display the times in a more clear way. This also was a way to get rid of the calendar feature all together. The one issue with this redesign is that it doesn’t show the user the amount of availably for each day- which means the user has to do a lot more clicking and interacting with the app to get a successful date chosen.

        <p>The second redesign I did. 
In this design I brought back the calendar idea- but at a smaller size. This would help the user choose the day they were most interested in and then be able to see the times available easier. While this design helped cut back some of the clicking and interaction the user has to perform- it gave the user more information at a glance. This did increase scrolling to get to the later times though.

        <p>The third redesign I did. 
This design requires the user to input a time they want to come in. Then below are shown the days in which that time and other times relatively close to that time are available. The user then can just select the appointment that is most appealing or scroll through to other days more in the future. This design is influenced by the fact that people have a specific time frame in mind when scheduling an appointment like this.  Also with the user inputting the time this will cut down on how much back and forth interactions the user will have to go through to find their ideal appointment slot. This will be a more challenging task for users who don’t have a specific time in mind- in which case when they input the time there will be an option “Show next available times” which will give the user all available times for the upcoming days.

        <p>The fourth redesign I did. 
With this design I focused on the action of selecting the exact time and days. How the user selects the time that they want an appointment at.  This task involves some interaction but lets the user select what the want- giving them control.  Then allows them to select which day they want to go in and instead of the previous versions that would show times all day this option would show available appointments that day at and around the time the user selected.  In this design the user has the option of selecting whether the time or day  or both matter most. The user can look through days around a certain time, or select a day and see all times available for that day, or lastly if they have a particular day and time they can focus in on their options choosing both more specifically.
